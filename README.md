YallaGo - Full-Stack Ride-Hailing Application
YallaGo is a complete, real-time ride-hailing ecosystem built from the ground up, inspired by modern platforms like Uber and Careem. This project is not just a UI clone; it's a fully functional, multi-part system that demonstrates a deep understanding of full-stack mobile application architecture.

The ecosystem consists of three distinct parts:

üì± A Flutter App for Customers: For requesting and tracking rides.

üöó A Flutter App for Drivers: For accepting and managing trips.

üñ•Ô∏è A Web-Based Admin Dashboard: For user verification and platform monitoring.
